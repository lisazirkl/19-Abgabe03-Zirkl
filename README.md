Test Automation 

Wrote some test methods to test:

- if stack is empty after initialization
- if stack is empty after pushing elements
- if stack is empty after pushing and popping the same amount of elements
- if it throws exception if you pop more elements than you pushed
- if it throws exception if you initialize StringStack with arguments <= 0
- if it throws exception if you push more elements than the stack was initialized with
